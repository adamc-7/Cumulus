# Cumulus

Detailed comments in frontend project files, I would recommend starting at ViewController.swift to understand them best.

Notes:
1. There is a bug where the settings button will not be displayed on initial login to app,
you will see it if you relaunch the program after initially logging in. 

2. You will have to add events in the calendar app in the simulator in order to see events in the app.
